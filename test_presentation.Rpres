What is phenology?
========================================================
Phenology refers to the study of timing of recurrent events, such as leaf emergence or leaf fall


The timing of phenological events is important for:
- monitor the impact of decidious trees on atmospheric carbon levels
- management of natural resources (water and timber)
- agriculture (planting and harvest times, pest control)
- understanding hazards (monitoring and prediction of drought and fire risk)

Study area
========================================================
Study area should have the following features :
- forest type
- sufficiently large size to justify the use of satellite imagery
- availability of recently acquired remote sensing data and topographic map
